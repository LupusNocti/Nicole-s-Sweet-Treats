                    The bakeshop is run by Nicole Mission since 2017. It started when she quit her corporate job and decided to start her own business and be a successful business woman. 
                    She borrowed money from her family and friends to start her pastry business which soon became the talk of the town and successful in less than a year.
                    Nicole’s Sweet Treats is a specialty cakes and pastry shop located at the ground floor in SM Consolacion near the main entrance. 
                    The store’s business hours are from 9 am to 10 pm. In 2019, the shop decided to offer hot and cold coffee as well. The shop is known for their freshly brewed coffee and oven fresh pastries. 
                    They use the freshest and organic coffee grounds that are locally produced in the foothills of Mt. Kanlaon, Negros Occidental. 
                    The shop is also known for their delectable and sumptuous cakes and pastries at a reasonable price. They have a yearly charity drive wherein they give free coffee and pastry to jeepney and bus drivers all over the metro.
